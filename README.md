# README
Here you find some example test cases I did as part of the Udemy course »The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)«.

If you check the file _package.json_ you will find at _devDependencies_ some modules used for making the tests easy to handle.

**mocha**
```
npm install mocha --save-dev
```

**expect**
```
npm install expect --save-dev
```

**supertest**
```
npm install supertest --save-dev
```

**rewire**
```
npm install rewire --save-dev
```
